## Artificial Intelligence Assignment (2023)

The assignment contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving the multi-knapsack problem.

The Multi-dimensional Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem that involves selecting items with given profits and resource usages to maximize the total profit while adhering to multiple constraints. This coursework demonstrates the application of genetic algorithm components such as selection, crossover and mutation to solve this problem effectively.

The coursework was completed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook environment.
